# odin-recipes
In this project I am going to practice and show all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far by following TheOdinProject.
I am going to build a basic recipe website.
The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website won't look very pretty by the time I've finished but it's important to keep in mind that the prupose of this project is to build my HTML chops.
I am going to reveisit this project in the future to style it up with the CSS.
