    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>In addition to being a delicious dessert, tiramisu offers the perfect segue when trying to steer the Valentine's dinner conversation towards spicier subjects. This heady, mood-elevating concoction is rich and deeply satisfying yet remarkably light in texture. Yes, you can use regular cream cheese, but mascarpone is far superior.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound mascarpone cheese</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons amaretto liqueur, or more to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup heave cream</li>
        <li>1 cup cold espresso</li>
        <li>24 ladyfingers, lightly toasted</li>
        <li>2 (1 ounce) squares unsweetened chocolate, divided</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk mascarpone cheese, sugar, and amaretto liqueur together in a bowl until smooth. </li>
            <li>Beat cream in a glass or metal bowl until soft peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: whipped cream should form soft mounds rather than a sharp peak. Fold whipped cream into mascarpone mixture. Pour espresso into a separate bowl. </li>
            <li>Dip 12 ladyfingers into espresso; arrange dipped ladyfingers in an 8-inch square baking pan. Spread ½ mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers; grate 1 chocolate square over mascarpone layer. Dip remaining 12 ladyfingers into espresso; arrange dipped ladyfingers on top. Spread remaining ½ mascarpone mixture over ladyfingers; grate remaining 1 chocolate square over mascarpone layer. Refrigerate tiramisu until set, at least 2 hours. </li>
        </ol>
